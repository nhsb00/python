# Data Structure

What is Data Structure?
- Data Structure is a fundamental concept of any programming language, essential for algorithmic design.
- It is used for the efficient organiztion and modification of data.
- DS is how data and the relationship amongst different data is represented, that aids in how efficiently various functions or operations or alogorithms can be applied.

# Types

There are two types of data structure: Linear and Non-Linear

- Linear data structure: if the elements of a data structure result in a sequence of a linear list then it is called a linear data structure. Example: Arrays, Linked Listm Stacksm, Queses etc.

- Non-linear data structure: if the elements of data structure results in a way that traversal of nodes is not done in a sequential manner, then it is a non linear data structure. Example: Trees, Graphs etc.

# Applications

Data structures form the core foundation of software programming as any efficient algorithm to a given problem is dependent on how effectively a data is stuctured.

- Identifiers look ups in compiler implementations are built using hash tables.
- Teh B-trees data structures are suitable for the databases implementations.
- Some of the most important areas where data structures are used are as follows
    Artificial intelligence
    Compiler design
    Machine learning
    Database design and management
    Blockchain
    Numerical and Statistical analysis
    Operating system development
    Image & Speech Processing
    Cryptography
